functions:
    functions are declared like this:
    ```
    @foo (arg1type arg1, arg2type arg2) {

    }
    ```
    functions are called like this:
    ```
    foo(arg1, arg2)
    ```
    HISS builtin functions are called like this:
    ```
    print!(1)
    ```

    for now all functions return ints

    ```
    for (i = 0, i < 10, i++) {

    }

    for (i in 30) {

    }
    ```
